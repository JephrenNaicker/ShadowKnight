# ShadowKnight
The highest rank knight, and well known in many kingdoms. Is framed for letting the shadow enter the kingdom even though he was fighting among the soldiers. A fair trial was set but, instead of the public jail they took him to a secret dungeon just passed the jail area. Only to be greeted by I Witch, and seeing the king he served for many yearâ€™s. As a Witch prophecy that a Knight within its own kingdom will be it destroyer. He was turned into a shadow (knight) demon himself and sunk into a void. That cast him far away, where no kingdom will go near, the magic forest, with little memory of how he got there must find a way to reach his kingdom and clear his name and hopefully turn back to normal.
